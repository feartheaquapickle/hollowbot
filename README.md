# hollowbot - A Discord Bot

## Information
Hollowbot is a very simple bot written in python for Discord use. As I learn new
functions I update it with new abilities.

So far the bot has very limited abilities. Below is a list of things it can do

### Detection:
- Detect when the word 'Heck' is used an issue a response

### Commands:
- Ping: Returns with ping time in ms
- Help: Custom help menu


### Cogs:
- Admin: Admin panel containing command for kick, ban etc
- Futurama: Contains set of commands to spawn random Futurama quote
- Dice: D6 dice function
- News: Custom news announcements
- Rules: Custom list of rules
- Roles: Custom list of roles (WIP)

These functions are limited and in development.
Final product is subject to change!
